Basic console Based Quiz application 
This console-based quiz application is a simple project designed for beginners to improve their basic programming skills. It focuses on important foundational concepts like arrays and control statements, which are essential for any programming language.

The application stores multiple questions and options using arrays, making it easier to access and display them during the quiz. It uses conditional statements like if-else and switch to check the user’s answers and respond accordingly. Loops are used to display questions one after another and to calculate the final score based on the user's responses.

By working on this project, beginners will learn how to take input from users, process that input, and display results in the console. This not only improves logical thinking but also strengthens understanding of how arrays and control flow work together in real programs. Overall, it’s a great starting point for anyone who wants hands-on practice with basic programming logic in a fun and interactive way.
